         About me:

         I'm an Aspiring Level Designer/Environment Artist and Student from Orlando, Florida. I often work on making mods for Satisfactory in my free time but mainly I work on improving my Game Development skills. I'm currently learning basic scripting with C++ and C# as well as working with Blender to create assets for my various projects. You can find some of them [here](https://github.com/SpaceGameDev568?tab=repositories). I am also passionate about Spaceflight and enjoy learning about it too.
